Hi there!

This is Bhushan Lodha (we met yesterday in your college just outside civil department) from HasStuff.com  which lets you buy/sell books within college students without having the need to go to local book stores which creates a lot of hassle as per their convenience and usually don't give good price on selling/returning books to them and asks for whopping 60-70% of the original price when buying.

We guys are in the process of finishing our website (say 2-3 weeks from now) which will be close to what olx or cragslist does but very limited and localised to college (your college), and minus the crap that you see on current classified websites. Since we don't have platform ready yet, we thought about starting with email list where you guys can email me your book requirements or the books you want to sell and I can try to find if anyone else wants to buy or sell amongst yourselves and share your contact details with them (off course with your permission)

Any information about the book you want to list with me would be great - title, publisher, author, etc. Better yet, you can just take a photo of the book and email or whatsapp me and I'll figure out the rest.

my email: bhushanlodha@gmail.com
whatsapp: +91-9975454384

Let's get started and exchange books,
Bhushan Lodha
